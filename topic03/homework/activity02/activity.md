## Description:
Make a program that is in an infinite loop showing the menu for a student registration system (i.e. 1. Add, 2. Delete, 3. Update, 4. Exit). Use a “switch” for selecting an option. When an option is selected, it should print the selected option e.g. “Add a student”. It should have an option to exit the program.
