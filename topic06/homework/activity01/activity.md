## Description:
Write a program that receives as input a telphone number as a string. It filters ‘ ‘ and  ‘-’ and '(' and ')'. And validates that it is a ten-digit long number and that all characters are digits. If the validation is successful, it prints "valid number"; otherwise it prints “invalid number”.
